## What This is NOT About

- Not about robotic surgery systems
- Not about hospital-wide AI infrastructure
- Not about machine learning research
- Not about tools you need IT approval for

> "We don't have an AI problem. We have an INTEGRATION problem."

---

## What This IS About

- **Tools you can start using TONIGHT**
- **Free or low-cost** AI accessible to any surgeon
- **Practical prompting** techniques
- **Real examples** from surgical practice

---

# Section 1: AI Prompting for Surgeons

---

## ChatGPT/Claude: Your 24/7 Surgical Assistant

### Three Use Cases You Can Try Today

**1. Literature Review & Summarization**
- Prompt: *"Summarize the latest 2024 guidelines on CABG vs PCI in left main disease. Focus on evidence quality and changes from 2020."*
- **Saves:** 2-3 hours of reading

**2. Patient Education Material**
- Prompt: *"Create a patient-friendly explanation of TAVR procedure, risks, and recovery. Use 8th-grade reading level."*
- **Saves:** 30 minutes per explanation

---

## ChatGPT/Claude (continued)

**3. Differential Diagnosis Thinking Partner**
- Prompt: *"62yo male, post-CABG day 3, new onset AFib, elevated troponins. Walk through differential diagnosis and suggest workup priorities."*
- **Benefit:** Catches blind spots

---

## Good Prompting vs Bad Prompting

**Bad Prompt:**
"Tell me about heart surgery complications"

**Good Prompt:**
*"I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon preparing a M&M presentation on a post-CABG mediastinitis case. List the top 5 evidence-based risk factors, cite recent studies, and suggest 3 quality improvement measures our team could implement."*

---

## The Difference

**Specificity**
- Specialty, context, purpose

**Desired format**
- List, citations, actionable items

**Scope limitation**
- Top 5, not everything

---

## Five Prompting Principles for Surgeons

1. **Give Context:** "I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon..."
2. **Specify Format:** "Create a table with 3 columns..."
3. **Set Constraints:** "Limit to 5 points, 100 words each..."
4. **Request Evidence:** "Cite recent RCTs from major journals..."
5. **Iterate:** Refine based on output, have a conversation

> **Key Point:** AI is not Google. It's a conversation partner.

---

# Section 2: NotebookLM

## Your Research Powerhouse

---

## What is NotebookLM?

**Simple Explanation:**
- **Free Google tool**
- Upload your documents (PDFs, notes, papers)
- AI becomes an expert on YOUR documents only
- Creates study guides, summaries, Q&A

**Why Better Than ChatGPT for Some Tasks:**
- Grounded in YOUR sources (no hallucination)
- Creates citations to exact pages
- Generates Audio overviews (podcast-style summaries)

---

## Use Case 1: Conference Prep

**Scenario:** You're attending ACTSSL and want to maximize learning

**Workflow:**
1. Download conference abstracts/papers (15-20 PDFs)
2. Upload to NotebookLM
3. Ask: "What are the top 5 emerging trends in cardiac surgery?"
4. Ask: "Create a study guide on novel TAVR techniques"
5. Generate audio overview to listen during commute

**Time Saved:** 10+ hours of reading

---

## Use Case 2: Literature Review for Publication

**Scenario:** Writing a paper on outcomes in re-do cardiac surgery

**Workflow:**
1. Upload 30-40 relevant papers to NotebookLM
2. Ask: "Create a table comparing patient selection criteria"
3. Ask: "What are the contradictory findings on mortality rates?"
4. Ask: "Draft an introduction paragraph synthesizing these findings"

**Result:** First draft of literature review in **2 hours vs 2 weeks**

---

## Use Case 3: Teaching & Case Preparation

**Scenario:** Teaching residents about complex congenital cases

**Workflow:**
1. Upload textbook chapters, recent case series, your case notes
2. Ask: "Create a teaching script for TOF repair, focusing on surgical decision points"
3. Ask: "Generate 10 quiz questions with explanations"
4. Create audio overview for residents to review pre-op

**Benefit:** Personalized teaching materials in minutes

---

## NotebookLM Pro Tips

**Best Practices:**
- Upload 10-50 documents (sweet spot for depth)
- Use the "Source-Grounded" feature for accurate citations
- Generate multiple audio overviews (different focuses)
- Pin key sources for priority

**Limitations:**
- Only as good as your uploaded sources
- Can't access external information
- May miss nuances expert readers catch

---

# Section 3: Practical Integration

---

## A Surgeon's Daily AI Workflow

**Morning (7:00 AM - Pre-rounds):**
- ChatGPT: "Summarize overnight literature alerts"
- **5 minutes**, stay current

**Pre-Op (8:00 AM):**
- NotebookLM: Review audio summary of similar cases
- **10 minutes**, mental preparation

**Between Cases (12:00 PM):**
- ChatGPT: "Draft consult note for 70yo with severe AS"
- **3 minutes**, structure thinking

---

## Daily Workflow (continued)

**Evening (6:00 PM):**
- NotebookLM: Upload today's interesting case notes + papers
- Generate summary for learning file
- **10 minutes**, deliberate practice

**Total AI Time:** 30 minutes
**Total Value:** Equivalent to 3-4 hours of traditional work

---

## Three Integration Principles

**1. Start with ONE use case**
- Pick your biggest time drain
- Use AI for that task for 2 weeks
- Measure time saved
- Then add another use case

**2. Validate AI outputs**
- Never copy-paste without review
- Use AI as first draft, not final product
- Verify medical facts against trusted sources
- Remember: AI can hallucinate

---

## Integration Principles (continued)

**3. Build it into existing workflow**
- Don't create new processes
- Replace existing steps with AI-assisted versions
- Make it effortless, not additional work

---

## The Three Cognitive Traps

### Avoid These!

**1. Cognitive Debt**
- Using AI without understanding the content
- **Antidote:** Always read AI summaries critically, verify key claims

**2. Cognitive Obesity**
- Too much AI-generated information, analysis paralysis
- **Antidote:** Set constraints (top 5, 1 page, 10 minutes)

**3. Inappropriate Cognitive Offloading**
- Letting AI make clinical decisions
- **Antidote:** AI suggests, surgeon decides. Always.

---

# Section 4: The Road Ahead

---

## Why This Matters NOW

**The Astro Teller Curve:**

![bg right:50% contain](assets/astro-teller-curve.png)

**Key Message:**
- AI adoption is exponential, not linear
- Gap between early adopters and late adopters grows exponentially
- In 3 years, AI fluency may be as essential as computer literacy

---

## For Surgeons

**Reality Check:**

- Your younger colleagues are **already using AI**
- Patients will start **expecting AI-informed care**
- Research/publications increasingly **AI-assisted**

> The time to learn is NOW, not later

---

## Your Action Plan - Start THIS WEEK

**Week 1: Setup (30 minutes)**
- Create ChatGPT or Claude account (free tier fine)
- Create NotebookLM account (free)
- Bookmark both

**Week 2-3: First Use Case (daily 10 minutes)**
- Pick ONE task: literature review, patient education, or case prep
- Use AI for that task every day
- Track time saved

---

## Action Plan (continued)

**Week 4: Expand (add 10 minutes)**
- Add second use case
- Teach one colleague
- Share one success story

**Month 2:**
- Integrated into routine
- Teaching residents
- Measuring impact

---

## Resources to Continue Learning

**Free Courses:**
- "Prompt Engineering for Healthcare" (Coursera)
- "AI for Clinicians" (Stanford online)

**Communities:**
- Twitter/X: #MedTwitter #AIinMedicine
- LinkedIn: Healthcare AI groups

**Practice:**
- 15 minutes daily with AI tools
- Deliberate practice with prompting
- Share learnings with team

---

# Conclusion

---

## Key Takeaways

### Three Things to Remember

1. **AI is accessible NOW:** Free tools, no technical expertise needed
2. **Start small, start today:** One use case, 10 minutes daily
3. **AI augments, not replaces:** You remain the expert; AI is your assistant

---

## Three Things to DO This Week

1. Create ChatGPT/Claude + NotebookLM accounts
2. Try ONE prompting use case from this talk
3. Share your experience with one colleague

---

## Final Thought

> "AI won't replace cardiac surgeons. But cardiac surgeons who use AI will replace those who don't."

> "The heart of surgery remains human judgment, compassion, and skill. AI simply frees us from computational drudgery to focus on what we do best—heal patients."

> "Wisdom shines forth everywhere" - Buddhih Sarvatra Bhrajate
