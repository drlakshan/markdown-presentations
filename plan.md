## Presentation Structure (15 minutes)

### OPENING (0:00 - 2:00)

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
- "Harnessing AI in the Heart of Surgery: A 15 Minute Primer"

**Slide 2: About the Presenter**
- Dr. MTD Lakshan credentials + QR code

**Slide 3: What This is NOT About**
- Not about robotic surgery systems
- Not about hospital-wide AI infrastructure
- Not about machine learning research
- Not about tools you need IT approval for

> "We don't have an AI problem. We have an INTEGRATION problem."

## SECTION 1: The Basics - AI Prompting for Surgeons (2:00 - 6:00)

**Slide 5: ChatGPT/Claude - Your 24/7 Surgical Assistant**

**Three Use Cases You Can Try Today:**

1. **Literature Review & Summarization**
   - Prompt: "Summarize the latest 2024 guidelines on CABG vs PCI in left main disease. Focus on evidence quality and changes from 2020."
   - Saves: 2-3 hours of reading

2. **Patient Education Material**
   - Prompt: "Create a patient-friendly explanation of TAVR procedure, risks, and recovery. Use 8th-grade reading level. Include what to expect day-by-day."
   - Saves: 30 minutes per explanation

3. **Differential Diagnosis Thinking Partner**
   - Prompt: "62yo male, post-CABG day 3, new onset AFib, elevated troponins. Walk through differential diagnosis and suggest workup priorities."
   - Benefit: Catches blind spots

**Slide 6: Live Demo - Good Prompting vs Bad Prompting**

**Bad Prompt:**
"Tell me about heart surgery complications"

**Good Prompt:**
"I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon preparing a M&M presentation on a post-CABG mediastinitis case. List the top 5 evidence-based risk factors, cite recent studies, and suggest 3 quality improvement measures our team could implement."

**The Difference:**
- Specificity (specialty, context, purpose)
- Desired format (list, citations, actionable items)
- Scope limitation (top 5, not everything)

**Slide 7: Five Prompting Principles for Surgeons**

1. **Give Context:** "I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon..."
2. **Specify Format:** "Create a table with 3 columns..."
3. **Set Constraints:** "Limit to 5 points, 100 words each..."
4. **Request Evidence:** "Cite recent RCTs from major journals..."
5. **Iterate:** Refine based on output, have a conversation

**Key Point:** AI is not Google. It's a conversation partner.

## SECTION 2: NotebookLM - Your Research Powerhouse (6:00 - 10:00)

**Slide 8: What is NotebookLM?**

**Simple Explanation:**
- Free Google tool
- Upload your documents (PDFs, notes, papers)
- AI becomes an expert on YOUR documents only
- Creates study guides, summaries, Q&A

**Why Better Than ChatGPT for Some Tasks:**
- Grounded in YOUR sources (no hallucination)
- Creates citations to exact pages
- Generates Audio overviews (podcast-style summaries)

**Slide 9: Use Case 1 - Conference Prep**

**Scenario:** You're attending ACTSSL and want to maximize learning

**Workflow:**
1. Download conference abstracts/papers (15-20 PDFs)
2. Upload to NotebookLM
3. Ask: "What are the top 5 emerging trends in cardiac surgery from these papers?"
4. Ask: "Create a study guide on novel TAVR techniques"
5. Generate audio overview to listen during commute

**Time Saved:** 10+ hours of reading
**Outcome:** Targeted learning, better questions to ask

**Slide 10: Use Case 2 - Literature Review for Publication**

**Scenario:** Writing a paper on outcomes in re-do cardiac surgery

**Workflow:**
1. Upload 30-40 relevant papers to NotebookLM
2. Ask: "Create a table comparing patient selection criteria across these studies"
3. Ask: "What are the contradictory findings on mortality rates?"
4. Ask: "Draft an introduction paragraph synthesizing these findings"

**Result:** First draft of literature review in 2 hours vs 2 weeks

**Slide 11: Use Case 3 - Teaching & Case Preparation**

**Scenario:** Teaching residents about complex congenital cases

**Workflow:**
1. Upload textbook chapters, recent case series, your case notes
2. Ask: "Create a teaching script for TOF repair, focusing on surgical decision points"
3. Ask: "Generate 10 quiz questions with explanations"
4. Create audio overview for residents to review pre-op

**Benefit:** Personalized teaching materials in minutes

**Slide 12: NotebookLM Pro Tips**

**Best Practices:**
- Upload 10-50 documents (sweet spot for depth)
- Use the "Source-Grounded" feature for accurate citations
- Generate multiple audio overviews (different focuses)
- Pin key sources for priority

**Limitations:**
- Only as good as your uploaded sources
- Can't access external information
- May miss nuances expert readers catch

## SECTION 3: Practical Integration into Your Daily Practice (10:00 - 13:00)

**Slide 13: A Surgeon's Daily AI Workflow**

**Morning (7:00 AM - Pre-rounds):**
- ChatGPT: "Summarize overnight literature alerts on cardiac surgery"
- 5 minutes, stay current

**Pre-Op (8:00 AM):**
- NotebookLM: Review audio summary of similar cases uploaded yesterday
- 10 minutes, mental preparation

**Between Cases (12:00 PM):**
- ChatGPT: "Draft consult note for 70yo with severe AS, multiple comorbidities. TAVR vs SAVR decision."
- 3 minutes, structure thinking

**Evening (6:00 PM):**
- NotebookLM: Upload today's interesting case notes + relevant papers
- Generate summary for learning file
- 10 minutes, deliberate practice

**Total AI Time:** 30 minutes
**Total Value:** Equivalent to 3-4 hours of traditional work

**Slide 14: Three Integration Principles**

**1. Start with ONE use case**
- Pick your biggest time drain
- Use AI for that task for 2 weeks
- Measure time saved
- Then add another use case

**2. Validate AI outputs**
- Never copy-paste without review
- Use AI as first draft, not final product
- Verify medical facts against trusted sources
- Remember: AI can hallucinate

**3. Build it into existing workflow**
- Don't create new processes
- Replace existing steps with AI-assisted versions
- Make it effortless, not additional work

**Slide 15: The Three Cognitive Traps (Avoid These!)**

**1. Cognitive Debt**
- Using AI without understanding the content
- **Antidote:** Always read AI summaries critically, verify key claims

**2. Cognitive Obesity**
- Too much AI-generated information, analysis paralysis
- **Antidote:** Set constraints (top 5, 1 page, 10 minutes)

**3. Inappropriate Cognitive Offloading**
- Letting AI make clinical decisions
- **Antidote:** AI suggests, surgeon decides. Always.

## SPEAKER NOTES

### Key Messages to Emphasize:
1. This is about tools you can use TONIGHT, not someday
2. Focus on time-saving, not replacement
3. Learning curve is gentle—just start

### Timing Checkpoints:
- 2:00 - Finishing intro, starting prompting basics
- 6:00 - Starting NotebookLM section
- 10:00 - Starting integration section
- 13:00 - Starting conclusion

### Tone:
- Practical, not preachy
- Peer-to-peer, not lecture
- Enthusiastic but realistic
- "Try this" not "you must"

### Demo Ideas (if tech available):
- Live ChatGPT prompt showing before/after
- Show NotebookLM interface with uploaded papers
- Show audio overview generation

### Questions to Anticipate:

1. **"Is this secure? What about patient data?"**
   - Never upload PHI to free AI tools
   - De-identify all data
   - Use institutional HIPAA-compliant tools for patient-specific info
   - These tools are for learning, research, education—not direct patient care

2. **"How accurate is AI?"**
   - ChatGPT can hallucinate (~10-15% error rate on medical facts)
   - Always verify with trusted sources
   - NotebookLM more reliable (source-grounded)
   - Use AI as first draft, not final answer

3. **"I'm not tech-savvy. Can I really do this?"**
   - If you can use Google, you can use these tools
   - Simpler than learning EMR
   - Start with copy-paste prompts from this presentation
   - 2-week learning curve to competency

4. **"What about cost?"**
   - ChatGPT free tier sufficient for most uses
   - Claude free tier also excellent
   - NotebookLM completely free
   - Paid versions ($20/month) optional for power users

5. **"Won't this make me lazy/reduce my knowledge?"**
   - Only if you use it passively
   - Use actively: prompt, critique, verify, learn
   - Think of it as having a smart intern who needs supervision
   - Cognitive offloading vs cognitive partnership
